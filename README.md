**Description of classes**

The system is designed with eight core classes, each representing a key part of the healthcare clinic. Every class includes private attributes with specific getter and setter methods to maintain data privacy and integrity.


The system is designed with eight core classes, each representing a key part of the healthcare clinic. Every class includes private attributes with specific getter and setter methods to maintain data privacy and integrity.
ClinicInformation: This class stores the clinic’s name, location, contact numbers, email, website, department and operating hours. It is a source for things that locates or identifies the clinic and it is used by another class which is the doctor and staff profiles, to know which clinic they belong to. The methods in this class allows users, specifically administrators to add or update the clinic details and then get those details for them to then be included on invoices for instance. 

DoctorStaffProfile: This class involves the doctors and other clinic staff and their attributes with are their names, their specialty, they’re qualifications, their working hours, contact information, availability and roles. These are all private attributes that belongs to the clinic. However twists public is the function provided and it is a doctor or staff being assigned to appointments after checking their working hours and their availability from the clinic information class. This class is linked to the handling of appointments and writing prescriptions and test ordering
. 
PatientProfile: This class stores what identifies a patient and provides their information that the clinic requires from them and its which is their name, date of birth, contact, address, emergency contact, insurance information, allergies and medical history. With this class, an account can be created for them to then being able to update their profile, which then allows appointments to be made and visit summaries to be downloaded. It is important that the patients details are private and specific roles of staff can only have access to specific patients. Furthermore, patients get to schedule their appointments and view their summaries. 

AppointmentScheduling: This class involves costs being scheduled between a specific patient and a staff, any of the clinic staff. It includes the ID of the appointment, the time of the appointment, the doctor involved and their specialty. The operations that would occur is and crucial in making appointments is being able to book appointments or reschedule them, based off of the doctor’s availability and also canceling appointments of marking them as complete. It has a relationship with the patients, clinic staff, billing information and the EMR which is relative to the complete appointment function since the EMR can be updated once an appointment is done.

EMR (Electronic Medical Record): This class will store the medical records electronically and it includes the record ID, patient’s ID, the visit dates, doctor’s ID, visit notes, lab orders, vitals, diagnoses, and attachments that are necessary. It is required when lab results are needed and prescriptions need to be assigned to a patient. It involves creating new records and also updating existing records, and those records can be viewed. Attachments can be added to them as there might be necessary things to ass like the billing information for example. 

PrescriptionsandMedications: This class represents the prescription order which means medications are needed to be prescribed. The elements in this class are the prescription ID, the patient’s ID, the doctor’s ID, record, the drug name, its dosage, the instructions, the list of medications, the date they were prescribed in and the status. It is linked to the EMR as the prescriptions are included in the medical record, and in this class a prescription is generated by adding medications and it can then be viewed and printed. 



BillingandInsurance: 
This class would manage the transactions made and whether insurance is in the process of making those financial transactions. For the invoice to be generated, details like the invoice ID, patient ID, appointment ID, consultation Fee, other charges, total amount, insurance coverage and payment method should be retrieved. In the process of that, the function of applying insurance can occur if the patient has it and once a payment has to be made then the process payment function is initiated and the invoice can be viewed after it’s complete. 

LabOrderResults: This class represents the action of ordering lab tests to then retrieve results from them that are relevant to the patient. It has attributes of order ID, patient ID, doctor ID, record ID, visit ID, status, result, result date, test name and necessary attachments that are needed like documents. These attributes support ordering tests, and then the upload of results and status to then be able to view the results. 


**Relationship of classes**

The classes in the system are interlinked to represent the real-world connections within a healthcare clinic. The relationships demonstrate how patients, doctors, appointments, and medical records interact during the clinic’s operations. Different relationship types, association, aggregation, and composition are used to show ownership, dependency, and collaboration among objects.

------------------------------------------------------

Clinic information —> DoctorStaffProfile (Aggregation)

DoctorStaffProfile —> AppointmentScheduling ( Association) 

DoctorStaffProfile —> PatientProfile (Association)

PatientProfile —> AppointmentScheduling (Association)

EMR —> PatientProfile (Composition) 

BillingandInsurance —> PatientProfile ( Aggregation) 

AppointmentScheduling —> EMR (Association) 

AppointmentScheduling —> BillingandInsurance (Association) 

EMR —> BillingandInsurance (Association) 

PrescriptionandMedication —> EMR (Composition) 

LabOrderandResults —> EMR (Composition) 

-----------------------------------------------


Aggregation: The ClinicInformation class aggregates multiple DoctorStaffProfile objects. This means a clinic can have several doctors and staff members, but each doctor or staff can exist independently of the clinic. Another aggregation relationship is how the billing and insurance details (which can be multiple based on the patient’s visits) can exist without the patient's existence as it is recorded.
Association: The PatientProfile class is associated with the AppointmentScheduling and DoctorStaffProfile classes, showing that patients book appointments with specific doctors. Similarly, patients are connected to BillingandInsurance through invoices and payments. Furthermore, a doctor can be associated with multiple patients (one or more) and interacts with them through having access to their profiles. The AppointmentScheduling class is associated with the EMR and BillingandInsurance class as the appointments are connected to the visits and visit notes in EMR, and with the BillingandInsurance class, invoices are generated after appointments are complete. In addition, the EMR is relative to the BillingandInsurance class as data like procedures and medications can be found there which then generates charges that can be added to the invoice.


Composition: Each PatientProfile class composes an EMR (Electronic Medical Record) for each visit. Therefore, if the patient profile is not there anymore, there won’t be an EMR either.  In turn, the EMR class composes related classes such as PrescriptionsandMedications and LabOrderandResults, meaning that if a medical record is removed, all linked prescriptions and lab results are deleted with it.





These relationships clearly define how information moves through the system from booking an appointment to recording a visit, issuing prescriptions, processing lab results, and completing billing ensuring that the model accurately reflects a real clinic’s workflow.



**Modularity:**
ClinicInformation: This class has the responsibility of managing the data of the clinic.

DoctorStaffProfile: This class manages the details of staff members including doctors and their availability.

Patient profile: This class manages the details of patients and their accounts. 

AppointmentScheduling: This class handles how appointments are booked and who’s involved. 

EMR: This class records every visit for each patient. 

PrescriptionsandMedications: This class manages the medication. 

LabOrderandResults: This class manages the orders of lab tests and their results. 

BillingandInsurance: This class manages financial transactions and if insurance is involved and can be applied. 




**Assumptions:**

-The doctor can be a specific type of staff which is why he’s in the same class, however with a specialty. 

-The system of the clinic could assume that all the classes are being handled and connected through the ID titles. 

-Each appointment is only relevant to one patient and one doctor.

-For every valid appointment or visit of a patient, the lab order and prescription and electric medical records are relevant to them. 

-For every appointment, a billing process is initiated with the assumption that per visit there’s one consultation.

Summary:

Summary of learning

This project was completed collaboratively as part of a two-person group. Working with my partner allowed us to share ideas, divide tasks, and solve challenges efficiently. Together, we designed the UML class diagram and implemented the Healthcare Clinic Management System in Python using key OOP principles such as encapsulation, aggregation, association, and composition.
Through this experience, we learned how to model real-world relationships between classes, protect data using private attributes, and create methods that simulate clinic operations like managing patients, doctors, appointments, and billing. The project strengthened our teamwork, communication, and coding skills while helping us apply object-oriented concepts to a real system.

Learning Outcomes Achieved

LO1_OOAD:
 We successfully analyzed and designed a system that models real-world entities and their relationships using UML class diagrams. The final design accurately reflects how a healthcare clinic functions and how its components interact.


LO2_OOProgramming:
 We developed a complete object-oriented Python program that translates the UML design into working code. The program demonstrates proper structure, data protection, and OOP features while efficiently handling core operations like appointment scheduling, patient management, and billing.


LO4_SWDocumentation:
 We produced clear and well-documented work, including the UML diagram, Python source code, and test cases. The documentation and code comments ensure readability, clarity, and understanding for the intended audience.
